## üßê What's this?

This `fileee-backup-downloader` is a hastily hacked script that logs into [Fileee](https://www.fileee.com/) with
[pupperteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) and downloads a full backup archive. I use the script
to create my own backup of my documents at regular intervals. Just to be sure.

<br />

## üéâ Features
- Login to [Fileee](https://www.fileee.com/) using username and password (no 2-Factor supported)
- Download ZIP archive in a temporary folder
- Move archive to given destination

<br />
